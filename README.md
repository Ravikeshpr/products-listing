## Following is the functionality and features implemented

1. React components are used to build UI components and CSS flex properties are used to make the app responsive.
2. Folder structure is made considering a big enterprise-level application.
3. RTK/Redux was not necessary for such a small app but has been used to demonstrate the knowledge.
4. Search functionality and filter are implemented using Redux and good practices of one-way data flow are used.
5. Test cases are on a high level due to a crunch of time.
6. Accessibility of the application is improved for better screen reader output.
7. Error handling is done using error boundary and error in state.
